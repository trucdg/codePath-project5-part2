# WebDev Project 5 - Data Dashboard - Re-attempt

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
Data can tell interesting stories. In this project, I will create a data dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API. I choose the Spooncular API and construct the dashboard view displaying the data for cooking recipes fetched from the API . The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered.

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [x] Fetch API data with the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax
- [x] Respond to events triggered by user interaction and handle user input
- [x] Use .map() to dynamically render a group of elements
- [x] Use .filter() to filter data based on user input

## üëÄ Required Features

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] Name of the Recipe
  - [x] Is the recipe vegan?
  - [x] Is the recipe dairy-free
  - [x] Cooking Time
  - [x] Cuisine
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**
  - categories are :
    - isVegan?
    - cooking time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [x] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

## Video Walkthrough
