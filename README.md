# WebDev Project 5 - Data Dashboard - Re-attempt

## Submitted by: **Truc Duong**

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Inspiration 
Data can tell interesting stories. In this project, I will create a data dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API.
In part one, I choose a public API and construct the dashboard view of the project. The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered.

Time spent: **_** hours spent in total

## üéØ Goals
By the end of this assignment I will be able to
- [ ] Fetch API data with the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax
- [ ] Respond to events triggered by user interaction and handle user input
- [ ] Use .map() to dynamically render a group of elements
- [ ] Use .filter() to filter data based on user input

## üëÄ Required Features

- [ ] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [ ] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [ ] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [ ] enter your stats here
- [ ] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [ ] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

## Video Walkthrough
